# ML_Project
E0270-Machine Learning Project

Abstract:
In this Project we have tackled the problem of training model on huge datasets by training them parallely on multiple cores using two algorithms namely Shotgun and Block Stochastic Coordinate Descent(BSCD), to obtain better performance in terms of time tolerating a slight increase in error.
